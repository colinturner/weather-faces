# Overview

This is a quick-and-dirty project to get familiar with the [Face API](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js), a wrapper around the popular machine learning library, TensorFlow.

## Getting started
1) Clone this repo and open it in VS Code.
2) Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.
3) Start a new live server.

## Using the web app
This part is fairly self-explanatory. The web app will boot up your webcam, after which it will decorate the browser with weather based on your facial expression's emotion. Try looking happy! Try looking sad! Try everything in between.
